# Deep Learning for Economics and Finance (February 26 - 28 & March 25 - 27, 2025)

This is an mini-course on "Deep Learning for Economics and Finance". 
Its hels in two sessions:

* Session 1: Wednesday, February 26th - Friday, February 28th, 2025
* Session 2: Tuesday, March 25th - Thursday, March 27th, 2025


## Purpose of the lectures

* This mini-course is designed for Ph.D. students in economics and related disciplines. It
introduces recent advancements in applied mathematics, machine learning, computational
science, and the computational economics literature. The course focuses on solving and
estimating dynamic stochastic economic models, performing parametric uncertainty quantification, solving continuous-time models (PDEs), and modeling sequence data using recurrent neural networks, LSTMs.
* The lectures will concentrate on machine learning methodologies, including Deep Neural
Networks, Gaussian Processes, advanced architectures like RNNs, PNNs, and LSTMs. These methods will be explored through applications in
macroeconomics, finance, and climate-change economics.
* The format of the lectures will be interactive and workshop-like, combining theoretical
discussions with hands-on coding exercises. The coding will be conducted in Python and
implemented on a cloud computing infrastructure


## Prerequisites

* Basic econometrics.
* Basic programming in Python (see [this link to QuantEcon](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) for a thorough introduction).
* A brief Python refresher is provided [under this link](python_refresher).
* A brief Python on Jupyter Notebooks is provided [under this link](python_refresher/jupyter_intro.ipynb). 
* Basic calculus and probability (The book [Mathematics for Machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) provides a good overview of skills participants are required to be fluent in). 


## Class enrollment on the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/)

Lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style,
using [Python](http://www.python.org), [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and
[Tensorflow probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) on [Nuvolos](http://nuvolos.cloud),
a browser-based cloud infrastructure in which files, datasets, code, and applications work together,
in order to directly implement and experiment with the introduced methods and algorithms.
